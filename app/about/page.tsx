        <p>
          TsafeLabs is an online learning and mock examination platform designed
          to help secondary school students prepare effectively for the Senior
          School Certificate Examination (SSCE).
        </p>

        <p>
          Our platform provides subject-focused practice, realistic timed exams,
          and exam-style questions that reflect the structure and difficulty of
          real SSCE assessments. Students can practice at their own pace, build
          confidence, and identify areas that need improvement before the actual
          examination.
        </p>

        <p>
          TsafeLabs currently supports core SSCE subjects including Mathematics,
          English, Chemistry, Biology, and Physics. Each subject is organized
          into topics to allow targeted revision and structured learning.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our goal is simple: to make exam preparation accessible, effective,
          and stress-free by combining quality practice materials with clear
          feedback and progress tracking.
